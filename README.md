## 9:00AM Set up

Plan to arrive 20-30 minutes before service begins to ensure everything is set up and any issues are addressed. Be aware, there is a silent alarm button under the far right side of the desk that can be used in case of emergency to call the police. This button should only be used in case of emergency.

1. Power on the main rack using the orange power button.

    ![](images/20191208_103954.jpg)

1. Locate the Power Conditioner on the desk.

1. Turn on the switch marked “**This Switch**”

    ![](images/20191208_103946.jpg)

1. Locate and adjust the sun shades (left switch) accordingly to ensure morning sunshine does not create issues before, during, or after each service.

1. Ensure the projector screen is in the down position (unless otherwise specified) using the right switch on the wall by the steps.

    ![](images/shades-and-screens.png)
 
1. (Optional): Turn on the desk rope lights.
1. Locate the PowerPoint DVD (usually it has a date on it.)
1. Insert the DVD in the Toshiba DVD unit (in the desktop rack).
1. Power on the projector using the wired remote to the right of the PC keyboard. Be patient. The projector takes a minute to become bright enough to see.

    ![](images/projector-remote.png)
 
1. Ensure the project is set to input source **S-Video**. This is the Toshiba DVD source.

1. Ensure the light on the projector screen is turned off. This can be done in one of two ways.

    * Using the switch panel at the base of the steps (on the wall), select setting “4”, or

    ![](images/lighting-control-1.png)
    ![](images/lighting-control-2.png)
  
    * Using the LCD built in to the wall (between the PC monitor and mixer), choose the setting “**SCRN OFF**".

    ![](images/lighting-control-3.png)
 
1. Power up the PC and login.

    ![](images/PC.png)
 
1. Start Audacity on the PC by clicking the icon shown below on the launch bar.

    ![](images/audacity-launch.png)

1. Check the batteries and test the wireless microphone for the assistant pastor. If you can, check with the Pastor(s) to ensure their microphones have full batteries.

1. Replace batteries if any display less than full (3) bars.

1. If the supply of batteries is running low, contact Shari Clark in the front office or Alan Johnson.

    Typically if you let Shari know when you turn in the CDs at the end of the service, new ones will be available for the following week.

1. Hearing aids are available upon request. They are located in the cabinet. Check to ensure the battery is working by turning it on and noting the red LED on the unit. If needed, replace the batteries.

    ![](images/cabinet.png)
 
1. Review the bulletin to familiarize yourself with the audio requirements. Consult Jerry Gunderson, the music director, for any special requirements (soloists, instruments, etc. that may be required.)

    If you like, use masking tape to denote special requirements below the faders (e.g. channel 5=soloist, channel 6=flutes, etc)

    ![](images/bulletin.png)

    >**With the exception of Pastor/asst minister mics, piano, and piano vocalist, mute all channels while not in use.**

## As Service Starts

1.	As the prelude fades out, just before the Pastor speaks, do the following simultaneously:

    * Hit **Record** on Audacity.

        ![](images/audacity-record-button.png)

    * Turn off the projector.

        Exception: Use the **PIC** button (top center) to simply "blank" the projector if you plan to use it for a Mission Minute or other presentation. This eliminates the "warming up" step of the projector if needed again during the service. You can then power it down at the end.

    * Turn on all sanctuary lights. On the LCD wall panel next to the PC monitor, click **ALL ON**.

1. Put the screen up during the entrance hymn. Doing this any other time is distracting as the noise of the screen motor is quite loud.

## During the Service

1. Adjust audio levels as needed.

    Use the headphones to balance vocals, instruments, etc. The headphones more accurately represent the audio being sent to the computer and may be quite different than what you can hear “over the air” from the main amps speakers.

    >Be cautious of adjusting the inputs too loud as this could cause feedback. The most common issue with faint sound is speakers not projecting or not being close enough to the microphone. Encourage guest speakers to hold handheld mics close to their mouth and/or adjust the pulpit microphone to within 2-4 inches of their mouth

1. If someone says they cannot hear, offer a hearing aid from the cabinet.

1. Within Audacity:

    * (During the recording) Select the main track.
    * Just prior to the Gospel, make a note of the Audacity time in your bulletin or hit Ctrl-M (mark). 

    ![](images/audacity-mark.png)
 
1. Similarly, just after the Sermon, mark the time again. This is important to note where the Gospel and Sermon are as they are saved as a separate output files in post-production.

    >HINT: Continue to monitor and adjust the audio as needed. Periodically, walk outside the sound booth to the rear and side of the sanctuary to listen to the sound being produced. This eliminates a lot of the noise produced by the PC and other equipment in the booth to give you a better indication of where adjustments may be needed.

## At the end of the Service

1. At the end of the service, when the assisting minister says “*Go in peace…*” end the recording by hitting Stop in Audacity.

    >This is a good time to **put the screen down**, use "**setting 4**" on the lights, and **turn the projector on** to display the announcements for the people leaving and others coming in for the 10:45 service.

1. Use **File> Export** to save the entire file in WAV file to the Desktop.

    ![](images/audacity-save-raw.png)

    Example filename: yyyy-mm-dd.wav

1. Leave the tags empty. (WAV files don't use tags.)

1. Click **OK**.

    ![](images/audacity-empty-tags.png)

1. After the WAV file has been saved to the desktop, start the **Levelator** application by clicking the icon shown below on the launch bar.

    ![](images/levelator-launch.png)
 
1. Use Windows Explorer to drag the WAV file on to Levelator.
 
    ![](images/levelator-main.png)
 
    The application:

    * Normalizes the audio by bringing up the low spots and bringing down the high spots for a more consistent listening experience.
    
    * Creates a new file in the same location with a suffix “.output”.

1. Go back to Audacity and select **File> New** to create a new empty project.

1. Select **File> Import Audio** to read in the “*.output*” WAV file.

1. When the popup window appears, click **OK**.

    ![](images/audacity-import-copy.png)
 
    The file will take a few seconds to import.

    ![](images/audacity-importing.png)

1. Identify the beginning of the Gospel and locate the cursor at that position.

    Use Zoom in (Ctrl-1 or magnifying glass + icon) and zoom out (Ctrl-3 or magnifying glass - icon) to accurately place the cursor as needed.

    ![](images/audacity-zoom.png)
 
1. Type **Ctrl-I** to split the audio at the cursor position.

1. Identify the ending of the sermon and locate the cursor at that position.

1. Type **Ctrl-I** to split the audio again.

1. Double click the audio between the two splits. This selects the entire Gospel reading and sermon (the area between the two splits you just created).

1. Use **File> Export Selection** to save that region as an MP3 format file in **\\\\Server\Sanctuary PowerPoints\Audio Sermons** in MP3 format. This folder is also available directly from the Desktop via the **Audio Sermons** shortcut.

    ![](images/audacity-export-selection.png)

1. Use the naming format: **yyyy-mm-dd-EventName-Pastor-xxxx.mp3**.
Example: 2016-01-10-BaptismOfOurLord-PrTerry-0900.mp3 (where 0900 is the 9:00AM service and 1045 is the 1045 service.)

    ![](images/audacity-save-mp3.png)

1. Tag the file like the following example:

	* Artist Name: **Pr. Kristin Rice - All Saints Lutheran Church, Phoenix AZ**
    * Track Title: **2nd Sunday of Christmas - *Sermon Title***
    * Album Title: All Saints Lutheran Church
    * Year: 2020
